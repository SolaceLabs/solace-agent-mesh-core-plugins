# How to contribute

We'd love for you to contribute and welcome your help. Here are some guidelines to follow:

- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Submitting a fix](#submitting)
- [Feature Requests](#features)
- [Questions](#questions)
- [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](#dco)

## <a name="issue"></a> Did you find a issue?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under *Issues*

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one

## <a name="submitting"></a> Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch following the steps outlined below. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search *Pull Requests* for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

## <a name="features"></a> **Do you have an ideas for a new feature or a change to an existing one?**

* Open a GitHub issue and label it as an *enhancement* and describe the new functionality.

##  <a name="questions"></a> Do you have questions about the source code?

* Ask any question about the code or how to use Solace technologies in the [Solace community](https://solace.community).

## <a name="dco"></a> Developer Certificate of Origin

Prior to contributing:
1. Read the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
2. Sign-off all commits using the [`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---no-signoff) option provided by `git commit`.

To sign-off your commits, use:
```
git commit --signoff --message "This is the commit message"
```
This option adds a Signed-off-by trailer at the end of the commit log message.
