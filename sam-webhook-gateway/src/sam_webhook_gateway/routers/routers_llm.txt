## Quick Summary
The `routers` directory contains FastAPI routers for the Universal Webhook Gateway. It is intended for any static or well-defined API endpoints the gateway might expose, such as health checks or administrative interfaces. Dynamic webhook endpoints are created directly in the main component, not here.

## Files Overview
- `__init__.py` - Initializes the `routers` directory as a Python package and documents its purpose.

## Developer API Reference

### __init__.py
**Purpose:** Initializes the `routers` directory as a Python package. This package serves as a container for FastAPI router modules.

**Import:** `import sam_webhook_gateway.routers`

**Classes:**
None

**Functions:**
None

**Constants/Variables:**
None

**Usage Examples:**
This package itself does not export any members. It is a container for other router modules. A developer would import specific router objects from modules created within this directory and include them in a FastAPI application.

```python
# Hypothetical example assuming a 'health.py' router exists in this directory.

# main_app.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
# from sam_webhook_gateway.routers.health import health_router # Hypothetical import

app = FastAPI(
    title="SAM Webhook Gateway",
    description="A universal gateway for processing incoming webhooks.",
)

# The router would be included in the main FastAPI application
# app.include_router(health_router, prefix="/management", tags=["Management"])

# This allows for modular and organized routing. For example, a request to
# /management/health would be handled by the health_router.
```
