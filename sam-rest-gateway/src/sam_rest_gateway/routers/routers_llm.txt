Here is the developer guide for the `routers` directory.

## Quick Summary
This directory contains the FastAPI router modules that define the REST API endpoints for the gateway. It exposes functionality for interacting with agents and managing artifacts. The API is versioned, with `v1` providing legacy synchronous endpoints and `v2` providing modern asynchronous endpoints for submitting and polling tasks.

## Files Overview
- `__init__.py`: Initializes the `routers` package.
- `artifacts.py`: Defines API endpoints for listing and downloading artifacts generated by agents.
- `v1.py`: Defines the legacy, synchronous v1 API endpoints for invoking agents. **(DEPRECATED)**
- `v2.py`: Defines the modern, asynchronous v2 API endpoints for submitting and polling tasks.

## Developer API Reference

---
### artifacts.py
**Purpose:** This module provides the REST API endpoints for managing artifacts. It allows clients to list all artifacts for a given session, list the versions of a specific artifact, and download the content of any artifact version. These endpoints are typically used to retrieve files generated by an agent during a task.

**Note:** The functions below are FastAPI route handlers. They are not meant to be imported and called directly from Python code. The usage examples demonstrate how to interact with the corresponding HTTP endpoints using a tool like `curl`.

**Functions:**
